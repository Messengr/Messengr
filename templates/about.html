            	<h1>End-to-end encryption messaging app with search capabilities</h1>

            	<p>This project implements a proof-of-concept app that provides strong end-to-end encryption for chats and allows users to search through their encrypted messages without the server learning the contents any message nor what the user searched for.</p>

            	<h2>Motivation</h2>

            	<p> Recently, WhatsApp, a popular messaging app, introduced end-to-end encryption capabilities for messages sent on its service. End-to-End encryption is great because it makes it impossible for the provider to learn the contents of the messages sent. However, while this improves privacy it forces the service to limit some potential functionality such as allowing the user to search through their messages on the server. If the user can't store all of the messages sent locally then the user loses the ability to search through those messages. We would like to introduce a web app that allows users to send messages to each other, encrypted end-to-end, but with the added ability of searching through their messages. By implementing a simplified version of the searchable encryption scheme in <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/832.pdf">"Practical Dynamic Searchable Encryption with Small Leakage"</a>, we aim to provide this searching capability to an end-to-end encryption web messaging app.</p>
